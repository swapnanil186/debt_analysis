Debt Analysis in Power BI

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the debt taken by different countries over time using Microsoft Power BI. The goal is to provide visual insights into global debt patterns, identify major debtors, and understand the trends across different regions and economic indicators. The analysis is based on publicly available datasets, specifically from the World Bank.

Features

üìä Interactive Visualizations: Dashboards showcasing debt trends, major debtors, and comparisons between countries.

üåç World Map: Geographical analysis to identify debt distribution across the globe.

üìà Dynamic Filtering: Use of drill-downs and slicers to interactively filter data by countries, indicators, and time periods.

Data Sources

The dataset used in this project was obtained from World Bank Data Catalog, and includes:

Country Name: Names of countries that have taken debts.

Country Code: Unique code for each country.

Indicator Name: Description of the type/status of the debt.

Indicator Code: Unique code representing each debt indicator.

Debt: Amount of debt (in USD).


Getting Started

To explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.


2. Download Power BI Desktop from Microsoft's website.


3. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore the analysis.


4. The data source can be downloaded from the World Bank and imported into Power BI for real-time updates.



How to Use the Dashboard

Navigate Between Pages: The dashboard has different pages for various analyses:

Debt Overview: Summary of total debt across different regions and indicators.

Country Comparison: Visualize and compare debt levels between multiple countries.

Trends Over Time: Analyze how the debt levels have changed over the years.


Drill Down & Filters: Use the filters on the right to select specific regions, time periods, or types of debt.

Q&A: Use the Q&A feature to type questions like "What is the total debt of India?" to get immediate insights.


Deployment

The project can be published to the Power BI Service for online access:

1. Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.


2. Click on Publish and log in with your Power BI credentials.


3. Choose a workspace to deploy the dashboard for sharing and collaboration.



Unit Tests

Several unit tests were conducted to validate the accuracy of the visualizations:

World Bank‚Äôs Debtor‚Äôs Chart: Verified interactions between visuals when selecting specific data points.

Debt Matrix Drill-Down: Checked the drill-down functionality for detailed insights.

Q&A Functionality: Tested the AI tool‚Äôs response to natural language queries.

World Map Visualization: Confirmed that the map accurately represents data based on country selection.


Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

Power BI Service: Publishing and sharing the dashboards online.

Data Sources: CSV files downloaded from World Bank.


Results

Identified countries with the highest debt burden and visualized trends across time.

Provided a clear understanding of which regions are most affected and how debt indicators vary by region.

Enabled policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions based on insights derived from the data.


Future Enhancements

Data Update Automation: Implement a Power BI Gateway to automate data refreshes from the World Bank.

Advanced Metrics: Introduce new metrics, such as debt-to-GDP ratio, for more comprehensive analysis.

User Interaction: Add custom user input options to tailor the analysis according to different scenarios.
